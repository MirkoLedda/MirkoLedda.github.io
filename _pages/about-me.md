In a nutshell: I am a **biologist**, **data scientist**, **engineer** and **programmer**.

I am currently working at the University of California Davis in the [Knapp Lab](https://knapp.plantsciences.ucdavis.edu/) on the genomics of strawberries. My research interest is on the development and application of computational and machine learning algorithms to various aspect of genomic analyses. Specifically, I am tackling genomic prediction for selective breeding, the *in silico* design of genotype markers in complex genomes, and genetic linkage and association studies with complex phenotypes. Some of my projects also involve population genetics. This work is used to inform the rational design of breeding experiments as part of the strawberry breeding program @ UC Davis.

Before starting my postdoc, I obtained a Ph.D. in Integrative Genetics and Genomics from UC Davis. My doctoral research focused on the prediction of RNA secondary structures and their biological functions in a cell. For this purpose, I developed machine learning algorithms and statistical methods for predicting data-directed RNA structures and mine functional RNA structure motifs from large transcriptome-wide RNA structure profiling datasets (see *[patteRNA](https://github.com/AviranLab/patteRNA)* and *[RNAprob](https://github.com/AviranLab/RNAprob)*).

Before that, I worked at the Nestlé Research Center in Switzerland on taste perception physiology under the supervision of Prof. Johannes le Coutre. During this time, I studied the molecular mechanisms underlying taste perception and the genetic drivers of human sensomic and metabolomic traits, in collaboration with Prof. Sven Bergmann and Prof. Zoltàn Kutalik from the University of Lausanne.

Prior to my experience in industry, I obtained an Engineering Diploma in Life Sciences with emphasis in Biotechnology from the HES-SO Valais-Wallis. For my thesis, I visited the University of Palermo in Italy for 6 months where I worked on genes to boost antibiotics production.

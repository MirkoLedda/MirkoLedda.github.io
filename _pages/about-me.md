In a nutshell: I am a **biologist**, **data scientist**, **engineer** and **programmer**.

I am currently working toward a Ph.D. in Integrative Genetics and Genomics with Prof. Sharon Aviran at the University of California Davis. My research interests focus on the prediction of RNA secondary structures and their biological functions in a cell. For this purpose, I am developing machine learning algorithms and statistical methods to mine RNA structural motifs from large transcriptome-wide RNA structure profiling datasets (see *[patteRNA](https://github.com/AviranLab/patteRNA)* and *[RNAprob](https://github.com/AviranLab/RNAprob)*).

Before that, I worked at the Nestlé Research Center in Switzerland on taste perception physiology under the supervision of Prof. Johannes le Coutre. During this time, I studied the molecular mechanisms underlying taste perception and the genetic drivers of human sensomic and metabolomic traits (in collaboration with Prof. Sven Bergmann and Prof. Zoltàn Kutalik from the University of Lausanne).

Prior to my experience in industry, I obtained an Engineering Diploma in Life Sciences with emphasis in Biotechnology from the HES-SO Valais-Wallis. For my thesis, I visited the University of Palermo in Italy for 6 months where I worked on genes to boost antibiotics production.

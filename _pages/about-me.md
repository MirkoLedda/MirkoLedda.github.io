In a nutshell: I am a **biologist**, **data scientist**, **engineer** and **programmer**. Chances are that anything related to science will interest me.

I am born in **Geneva**, Switzerland but my passion for science led me to many places in Switzerland and abroad. I am currently working toward a Ph.D. in Integrative Genetics and Genomics in Prof. Sharon Aviran Lab at **UC Davis** in California. My research interests focus on understanding how RNA structures drive biological functions in a cell. In particular, I am developing machine learning algorithms and statistical methods to mine RNA structural motifs from transcriptome-wide RNA structure profiling data (see *[patteRNA](https://github.com/AviranLab/patteRNA)* for example). I am also interested in using RNA structure information to develop and engineer molecular bio-systems.

Before that, I worked at the **Nestlé Research Center** in Switzerland on taste perception physiology at the molecular level under the supervision of Prof. Johannes le Coutre, and genetic drivers of human sensomics and metabolomics in collaboration with Prof. Sven Bergmann and Prof. Zoltàn Kutalik from the University of Lausanne.

Prior to my experience in industry, I obtained an Engineering Diploma in Life Sciences with emphasis in Biotechnology from the **HES-SO Valais-Wallis**. For my thesis, I visited the **University of Palermo** in Italy for 6 months where I worked on genes to boost antibiotics production.

In my spare time I like to hike, take pictures, play soccer, ski steep slopes and enjoy the Californian sun.

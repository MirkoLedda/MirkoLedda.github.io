In a nutshell: I am a **biologist**, **data scientist**, **engineer** and **programmer**.

I am currently a postdoctoral researcher in the [Biomedical Data Science group](https://wwwen.uni.lu/lcsb/research/biomedical_data_science) at the University of Luxembourg headed by Prof. Enrico Glaab. My research interests are at the interface between biology, mathematics and programming, in particular interpretable network and machine learning approaches to integrate omics data, model neurodegenerative diseases and generate functional hypotheses for the development of novel therapeutics.

Briefly, I graduated as a Biotechnology engineer from the University of Applied Sciences in Switzerland and visited the University of Palermo in Italy for my thesis where I worked on identifying genes to boost antibiotic production in a bacterial system. I then moved to industry, at the Nestlé Research Center in Switzerland in the Perception Physiology group headed by Prof. Johannes le Coutre. There I focused on molecular mechanisms underlying taste perception and the genetic drivers of human sensomic and metabolomic traits, in collaboration with Prof. Sven Bergmann and Prof. Zoltàn Kutalik from the University of Lausanne. I then moved to the University of California - Davis to start a Ph.D. in Integrative Genetics and Genomics. My doctoral research focused on machine learning algorithms and statistical methods for RNA secondary structure prediction in large datasets (see *[patteRNA](https://github.com/AviranLab/patteRNA)* and *[RNAprob](https://github.com/AviranLab/RNAprob)*). After completing my Ph.D., I moved to the [Knapp Lab](https://knapp.plantsciences.ucdavis.edu/), working on strawberry genomics, and specifically the analysis of large pedigrees, the *in silico* design of genotype markers in complex genomes (see *[PolyOligo](https://github.com/MirkoLedda/polyoligo)* and *[Polyoligo - Webapp](http://ec2-52-52-41-39.us-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com/)*), and genetic linkage and association studies with complex phenotypes.

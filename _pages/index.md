I am Mirko, a PhD candidate in Integrative Genetics and Genomics developing computational methods for the analysis of large genomics data @ UC Davis.

I focus on RNA secondary structures but if you are here chances are you know that already... If not, click [here](/pages/about-me.html) to get to know me.
